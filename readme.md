I tried to write some code that would calculate the running times of varios popular movies.

I got the `top-grossing.txt` file from someplace, and `running-times` from imdb.

I hit a snag on matching up movie titles between the two files. The movie titles differ too much, and since I didn't want to create a fuzzy-matching mechanism, I chose to give up on the program.

It is worth keeping around because I learned a lot from it.

 - Use of Lazy module for parsing files asynchronously.
 - The code is very testable.
